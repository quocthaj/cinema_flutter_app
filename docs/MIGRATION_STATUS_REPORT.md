## 🔄 IN-PROGRESS MIGRATIONS

### 2. Booking Module (0%)

| File | Status | Priority | Estimated Time |
|------|--------|----------|----------------|
| `booking_screen.dart` | 🔴 TODO | P0 (Critical) | 4-6 hours |

**Current Issues:**
```dart
// ❌ Problem 1: Hardcoded dates
final List<String> availableDates = ["11/10", "12/10", ...];

// ❌ Problem 2: Hardcoded times
final List<String> availableTimes = ["10:00", "13:00", ...];

// ❌ Problem 3: Hardcoded seats
final List<String> seatList = ["A1", "A2", ..., "C5"];

// ❌ Problem 4: Fake sold seats
final List<String> soldSeats = ["A3", "B1", "C5"];

// ❌ Problem 5: Fake booking (no actual save)
await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));
```

**Required Changes:**
1. Load showtimes from Firestore by movieId
2. Get screen layout from Firestore by screenId
3. Check bookedSeats from Showtime to show unavailable seats
4. Calculate real price based on seat types (regular/vip)
5. Call `firestoreService.createBooking()` with transaction
6. Handle booking success/failure properly

**Dependencies:**
- FirestoreService.getShowtimesByMovie()
- FirestoreService.getScreenById()
- FirestoreService.createBooking()
- FirebaseAuth (get current user)

---

### 3. Tickets Module (0%)

| File | Status | Priority | Estimated Time |
|------|--------|----------|----------------|
| `ticket_screen.dart` | 🔴 TODO | P0 (Critical) | 2-3 hours |

**Current Issue:**
```dart
// ❌ Empty list - no data shown to user
final List<Ticket> userTickets = [];
```

**Required Changes:**
1. Get current user from FirebaseAuth
2. Load bookings via `firestoreService.getBookingsByUser(userId)`
3. For each booking, load nested data (movie, showtime, theater)
4. Display booking cards with status badges
5. Implement cancel booking functionality
6. Add empty state UI ("Bạn chưa có vé nào")

**Dependencies:**
- FirestoreService.getBookingsByUser()
- FirestoreService.getMovieById()
- FirestoreService.getShowtimeById()
- FirestoreService.getTheaterById()
- FirestoreService.cancelBooking()
- FirebaseAuth.currentUser

## 🎯 PRIORITY MATRIX

### P0 - Critical (Blocks User Features)
1. 🔴 **booking_screen.dart** - Users can't actually book tickets
2. 🔴 **ticket_screen.dart** - Users can't see their bookings

### P1 - High (Improves UX)
3. 🟡 Error handling for all Firestore operations
4. 🟡 Loading states for all async operations
5. 🟡 Empty states for all list views

### P2 - Medium (Nice to Have)
6. 🟢 Delete mock data files (`mock_theaters.dart`, `mock_Data.dart`)
7. 🟢 Performance optimization (caching, pagination)
8. 🟢 Analytics integration

### P3 - Low (Future Enhancements)
9. ⚪ Offline support
10. ⚪ Push notifications
11. ⚪ Advanced search & filtering

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Fixed Issues ✅:
1. ✅ Theater model field mismatch (logoUrl, description) → Fixed
2. ✅ StreamBuilder not closed → Fixed
3. ✅ Mock theaters import → Removed
4. ✅ Compilation errors in theater screens → Fixed

### Open Issues 🔴:

2. 🔴 Ticket screen shows empty list
3. 🔴 No actual booking creation
4. 🔴 No payment integration

### Potential Issues ⚠️:
1. ⚠️ Too many Firestore reads (need caching)
2. ⚠️ No offline support
3. ⚠️ No pagination for large datasets
4. ⚠️ No error retry logic

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Today):
1. **Start booking_screen.dart refactor**
   - Replace hardcoded dates with Firestore showtimes
   - Load screen seats from Firestore
   - Show real booked seats
   - Implement createBooking() call

### Short-term (This Week):
2. **Complete booking_screen.dart**
   - Add loading/error states
   - Test booking creation
   - Verify transaction works (seats are marked as booked)

3. **Start ticket_screen.dart refactor**
   - Load user bookings from Firestore
   - Display booking details
   - Add cancel functionality

### Medium-term (Next Week):
4. **Cleanup & Testing**
   - Delete mock data files
   - Test end-to-end flow
   - Fix any bugs found

5. **Optimization**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement pagination
   - Performance profiling

## 💬 SUMMARY

### What's Working ✅:
- Complete Firestore architecture with 7 models
- Full CRUD service layer (400+ lines)
- Automatic data seeding via admin panel
- Theaters module fully migrated
- Real-time data streaming
- Zero compilation errors

### What Needs Work 🔴:
- Booking screen (critical - blocks user bookings)
- Ticket screen (critical - user can't see their tickets)
- End-to-end booking flow testing

### Estimated Completion Time:
- **Booking Screen:** 4-6 hours
- **Ticket Screen:** 2-3 hours
- **Testing & Cleanup:** 2 hours
- **Total:** 8-11 hours

### Recommendation:
🚀 **Start with `booking_screen.dart` migration immediately** - This is the highest priority as it blocks the core functionality of the app (users can't book tickets).

---

**Status:** ✅ Ready to continue migration  
**Last Updated:** Now  
**Next Action:** Refactor `booking_screen.dart`
