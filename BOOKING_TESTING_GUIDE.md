## 📊 FIRESTORE QUERIES

### **Read Operations:**

```dart
// Booking Screen
getShowtimesByMovie(movieId)           // ~1-10 reads
getScreenById(screenId)                 // 1 read
getTheaterById(theaterId)               // 1 read

// Ticket Screen
getBookingsByUser(userId)               // ~1-50 reads (depends on user)
getMovieById(movieId)                   // 1 read per booking
getShowtimeById(showtimeId)             // 1 read per booking
getTheaterById(theaterId)               // 1 read per booking

Total per booking flow: ~10-20 reads
```

### **Write Operations:**

```dart
// Create Booking (Transaction)
createBooking(booking)                  // 2 writes (booking + showtime)

// Cancel Booking (Transaction)
cancelBooking(bookingId)                // 2 writes (booking + showtime)

Total per booking: 2 writes
```

### **Cost Estimation:**

```
Free tier: 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day

Scenario: 100 bookings/day
- Reads: 100 * 20 = 2,000 reads (4% of quota)
- Writes: 100 * 2 = 200 writes (1% of quota)

✅ Well within free tier
```

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue 1: Seat grid not showing**
**Cause:** Screen data not loaded
**Fix:** Check `_loadShowtimeDetails()` is called
**Validation:** `selectedScreen != null`

### **Issue 2: Price shows 0**
**Cause:** Showtime prices not set in seed data
**Fix:** Check `seedShowtimes()` in SeedDataService
**Validation:** `showtime.basePrice > 0`

### **Issue 3: Cancel button not working**
**Cause:** Booking status already "cancelled" or "completed"
**Fix:** Check `booking.canCancel()` logic
**Validation:** Button only shows for pending/confirmed

### **Issue 4: Double booking**
**Cause:** Transaction not working
**Fix:** Ensure Firestore rules allow transactions
**Validation:** Test with 2 devices
